Okay so after extensive testing and research, I'm finally starting to understand. This is a modular system. cmake at the root of the cmake project, and then cmake the target project. 

cmake configures everything
cmake --build does the building 
then make

so:

cmake ../..
cmake --build . --target cmakeEx_proj
make

then your target executable is at ./src/cmakeEx_proj
